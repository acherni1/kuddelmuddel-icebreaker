It started off as a perfectly normal day in Berlin, but things were about to get interesting.
I donned my Dirndel and grabbed the keys to my BMW.
Suddenly an apfelkuchen dropped from the sky, smashing against the pavement and splattering my Dirndel!
As I tried to clean up, I heard a noise and saw a hund running at full speed towards me.
I grabbed a doener from my briefcase and threw it away from me, hoping to distract the beast.
